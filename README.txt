# HEMS Logger v1.5
New:
1) **Update Now** button next to Landing time â€” sets Landing to current time and recalculates Take-off based on Flight minutes.
2) **Running total** of flight time in HH:MM at the bottom of the list (Total Today for 'Today' view, Total (Shown) for 'All').

All previous fixes retained (date robustness, compact log, GPS, CSV export, Clear Today, PWA).
